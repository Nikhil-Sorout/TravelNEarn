# Payment Verification Fixes - Frontend Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the frontend changes implemented to fix the payment verification issue where second consignment payments were incorrectly showing as completed for the first consignment owner.

## Problem
The backend required the `consignmentId` parameter to be included in payment verification requests to properly track which consignment's payment status should be updated. The frontend was not passing this parameter, causing payment status updates to be applied to the wrong consignment.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Updated Notification.js Payment Verification
**File:** `Src/Screens/Home/Notification.js`
**Function:** `verifyPayment`

**Changes:**
- Added `consignmentId` parameter to the function signature
- Updated console logging to include consignmentId
- Added `consignmentId` to the request body sent to `/p/verify-order` endpoint
- Added null fallback for consignmentId in the request

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before
const verifyPayment = async ({
  razorpay_order_id,
  razorpay_payment_id,
  razorpay_signature,
  phoneNumber: paymentPhoneNumber,
  amount,
  travelId,
  title = "Ride Payment",
  notification = null,
}) => {

// After
const verifyPayment = async ({
  razorpay_order_id,
  razorpay_payment_id,
  razorpay_signature,
  phoneNumber: paymentPhoneNumber,
  amount,
  travelId,
  consignmentId, // âœ… ADDED
  title = "Ride Payment",
  notification = null,
}) => {
```

### 2. Updated WalletWebViewScreen.js Payment Verification
**File:** `Src/Screens/Home/WalletWebViewScreen.js`
**Function:** `verifyPayment`

**Changes:**
- Added extraction of `consignmentId` from route params
- Updated console logging to include consignmentId
- Added `consignmentId` to the request body sent to `/p/verify-payment` endpoint
- Added null fallback for consignmentId in the request

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before
const verificationPhoneNumber = route.params?.verificationPhoneNumber;

// After
const verificationPhoneNumber = route.params?.verificationPhoneNumber;
const consignmentId = route.params?.consignmentId; // âœ… ADDED
```

### 3. Updated PayNowScreen.js Payment Flow
**File:** `Src/Screens/CustomerFlow/PayNowScreen.js`
**Function:** `create_payment_order`

**Changes:**
- Ensured `consignmentId` is properly passed to WalletWebViewScreen navigation
- Added comment to clarify the consignmentId parameter

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before
consignmentId: finalConsignmentId,

// After
consignmentId: finalConsignmentId, // Ensure consignmentId is passed
```

### 4. Fixed Payment Status Storage Logic
**Files:** `Src/Screens/Home/Notification.js`, `Src/Screens/Home/WalletWebViewScreen.js`

**Problem:** The frontend was storing payment status using only `travelId` as the key, causing all consignments with the same `travelId` to be marked as paid when one consignment's payment was successful.

**Changes:**
- Updated payment status storage to use combination of `travelId` and `consignmentId` as the key
- Added helper functions to check payment status correctly
- Updated all payment status checks to use the new logic

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before (WalletWebViewScreen.js)
paidNotifications[travelId] = true;

// After (WalletWebViewScreen.js)
const paymentKey = consignmentId ? `${travelId}_${consignmentId}` : travelId;
paidNotifications[paymentKey] = true;

// Before (Notification.js)
!paidNotifications[item.travelId] &&

// After (Notification.js)
const isNotificationPaid = (travelId, consignmentId) => {
  const paymentKey = getPaymentKey(travelId, consignmentId);
  return paidNotifications[paymentKey] === true;
};
!isNotificationPaid(item.travelId, item.consignmentId) &&
```

## API Endpoints Updated

### 1. `/p/verify-order` (Notification.js)
- **Purpose:** Payment verification for notification-based payments
- **Added Parameter:** `consignmentId`
- **Usage:** Called from notification payment flows

### 2. `/p/verify-payment` (WalletWebViewScreen.js)
- **Purpose:** Payment verification for web-based Razorpay payments
- **Added Parameter:** `consignmentId`
- **Usage:** Called from WalletWebViewScreen after successful Razorpay payment

## Testing Checklist

### âœ… Completed Changes
- [x] Updated Notification.js verifyPayment function
- [x] Updated WalletWebViewScreen.js verifyPayment function
- [x] Updated PayNowScreen.js payment flow
- [x] Added consignmentId parameter to both API endpoints
- [x] Added proper error handling and null fallbacks
- [x] Fixed payment status storage logic to use travelId + consignmentId combination
- [x] Updated all payment status checks to use the new logic
- [x] Added helper functions for payment status management

### ðŸ”„ Required Testing
- [ ] Test payment with single consignment
- [ ] Test payment with multiple consignments on same travel
- [ ] Verify only the correct consignment's payment status is updated
- [ ] Test payment decline functionality
- [ ] Verify backward compatibility (if consignmentId is missing)
- [ ] Test both notification-based and web-based payment flows

## Key Benefits

1. **Accurate Payment Tracking:** Each consignment's payment status is now tracked independently
2. **Multiple Consignment Support:** Multiple consignments on the same travel can have different payment statuses
3. **Backward Compatibility:** Null fallbacks ensure the system works even if consignmentId is missing
4. **Better Debugging:** Enhanced logging includes consignmentId for easier troubleshooting

## Files Modified

1. `Src/Screens/Home/Notification.js` - Updated verifyPayment function and payment status logic
2. `Src/Screens/Home/WalletWebViewScreen.js` - Updated verifyPayment function and payment status storage
3. `Src/Screens/CustomerFlow/PayNowScreen.js` - Updated payment flow
4. `PAYMENT_VERIFICATION_FIXES.md` - This documentation file

## Next Steps

1. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the payment flows with multiple consignments
2. **Monitoring:** Monitor payment verification logs to ensure consignmentId is being passed correctly
3. **Validation:** Verify that payment status updates are applied to the correct consignments
4. **Documentation:** Update any user-facing documentation if needed

## Notes

- The changes maintain backward compatibility by using null fallbacks for consignmentId
- Both payment verification endpoints (`/p/verify-order` and `/p/verify-payment`) have been updated
- Enhanced logging has been added to help with debugging and monitoring
- The existing payment flow structure remains unchanged, only the verification step has been enhanced

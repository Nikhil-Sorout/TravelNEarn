# Final Timestamp Fix for Consignment History Details

## Problem
The timestamps were showing incorrect times even after the date parsing fix because the code was trying to convert already-localized time strings.

## Root Cause
The backend was sending pre-formatted local time objects:
```javascript
{
  "date": "25/8/2025",
  "time": "8:58:33 am", 
  "day": "Monday"
}
```

The time string `"8:58:33 am"` was already in the correct local time format, but the code was trying to parse it and convert it again, causing the wrong time to be displayed.

## Solution
Simplified the logic to directly use the pre-formatted local time without any conversion:

### Before (Complex Conversion)
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Trying to convert already-localized time
const timeMatch = timeStr.match(/(\d+):(\d+):(\d+)\s*(AM|PM)/i);
const localDate = new Date(year, month - 1, day, hours, minutes, seconds);
const localTime = localDate.toLocaleTimeString('en-US', {...});
```

### After (Direct Usage)
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Using pre-formatted local time directly
const timeWithoutSeconds = timeData.time.replace(/:\d{2}\s/, " ");
return timeWithoutSeconds;
```

## Expected Result
- **Input**: `"8:58:33 am"`
- **Before**: `2:28 PM` (incorrect conversion)
- **After**: `8:58 am` (correct, just removing seconds)

## Files Modified
- `Src/Screens/Menu/Details/ConsignmentHistoryDetails.js` - Simplified both `formatTimeLocal` and `formatDateLocal` functions

## Key Changes
1. **Removed complex parsing logic** for pre-formatted objects
2. **Direct usage** of time strings that are already in local format
3. **Simple seconds removal** using regex: `.replace(/:\d{2}\s/, " ")`
4. **Maintained UTC timestamp handling** for other cases

## Testing
The fix ensures that:
1. Pre-formatted local time objects display correctly
2. UTC timestamps are still handled properly
3. Time format is consistent (removes seconds)
4. Date format is correct
